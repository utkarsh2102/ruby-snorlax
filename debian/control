Description: Snorlax is a flexible controller for Rails APIs
 Snorlax is an opinionated, flexible, and well-RESTed gem
 for building Rails APIs. It's designed to Do The Right Thingâ„¢
 by default, but allow you to customize where necessary.
 Snorlax is designed to provide a set of flexible API
 endpoints for client side consumption. It uses side loading,
 which means that all of the records returned are unnested
 and easily available for consumption.
